# 7nm FinFET Inverter Characterization

Welcome! This repo contains the methodology, netlist, and results for characterizing a 7nm FinFET CMOS inverter by sweeping the number of fins on PMOS and NMOS devices.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To analyze and compare how different configurations of PMOS (nfin_p) and NMOS (nfin_n) transistor fins affect key inverter performance metrics using ngspice simulation.
- **Method:** For each configuration, the inverter netlist is updated to set the number of fins, then run in ngspice (open-source SPICE). Key performance results are extracted and tabulated for comparison.

## Directory Overview

- **results/**: Contains raw and processed simulation data tables.
- **README.md**: This project overview and usage guide.

## Key Simulation Parameters

| Parameter | Meaning                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| nfin_p    | Number of fins for the PMOS transistor           |
| nfin_n    | Number of fins for the NMOS transistor           |
| Id (A)    | Drain current                                    |
| Power (W) | Operating (dynamic or static, see notes) power   |
| tpd (ps)  | Propagation delay (picoseconds)                  |
| Gain (Av) | Maximum voltage gain                             |
| NML/NMH   | Noise margin low/high (V)                        |
| gm (S)    | Maximum transconductance                         |
| f (Hz)    | Maximum operating frequency                      |

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `results/inverter_characterization_table` for run-by-run simulation data.
3. (Optional) Run the provided netlist in ngspice with your own parameter sweeps – see comments in the file for guidance.

## Results

See the [`results/inverter_characterization_table`](./results/inverter_characterization_table) file for the full tabulated data from all 12 test configurations.
